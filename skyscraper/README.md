# Puzzle Problem
### City Blocks ###
This program accepts a sequence of numbers (4 times the grid size, for a grid up to 9x9) from the CLI. It then displays a two-dimensional grid. The numbers range from 1 to the size of the grid, and each number must be unique within its row and column. The input numbers represent the views from the edges of the grid, in the following order: the views from the top of each column, the views from the bottom of each column, the views from the left of each row, and the views from the right of each row. Looking from any edge, you will only be able to see certain numbers, as taller (higher) numbers block smaller (lower) numbers from view. The numbers visible to you depend on the restrictions set by the perspective from the grid's edges.
